	    These are my favourite books:
		<ul>
		    <li>The Hunger Games</li>
			<li>Fault In Our Stars</li>
			<li>Harry Potter</li>
		</ul>		
		<b>However, I can describe these a lot better.</b>
		<br>
		The Hunger Games:
		<br><p>I love this because it is empowering.</p>
		Fault in Our Stars:
		<br><p>I like this because it makes me appreciate life</p>
		Harry Potter:
		<br><p>I love this because it is full of suspense.</p>
		<p><i>I can say that this is mostly everyone's favourite.</i></p>
		<br><br>But if I were to rank the:
		<ol>
			<li>Harry Potter<br><br>And my favourite characters are:
			    <ul style ="list-style-type:disc">
				    <li>Hermione</li>
					<li>Ron</li>
				</ul>
			    And my least favourite characters are:
				<ul style ="list-style-type:disc">
				    <li>Draco Malfoy</li>
					<li>Ginny</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>The Hunger Games</li>
			<li>Fault In Our Stars</li>
